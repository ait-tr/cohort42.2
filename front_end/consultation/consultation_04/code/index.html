            "The Simpsons" is an American animated sitcom created by Matt
            Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical
            depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which
            consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in
            the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture,
            society, television, and many aspects of the human condition.
